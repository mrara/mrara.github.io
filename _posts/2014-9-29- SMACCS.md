##  SMACCS

CSS is easy and difficult!

1. Organization – easy to fix 

2. Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)

3. Naming – choose the right name

4. Easy – don’t have to think 

5. IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT! – many changes needed to be make

Methodology is used for solutions of 1, 2, and 3. 

SMACCS – Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS – A way to examine design process and as a way to 

fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. 

4 primary categories – base rules (HTML tag selectors), layout rules (major blocks of the site, prefix the 

class name with l- or layout-), module rules (layout components, module rule selectors should only be 

classes), and state rules (ways to describe how layouts or modules look when in different states).
