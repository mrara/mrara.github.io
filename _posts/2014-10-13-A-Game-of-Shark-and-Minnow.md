## A Game of Shark and Minnow 
It was really the first time for me to read an interactive article like this. 
It is surprising that not only moving image but also there is sound on it. 
This makes user wants to scroll down and view all content. 
However, on the other side, it is distracting in a way that user could focus more onto the interactive effect than its content, like reading the text. 
Overall, it was new thing for me to take a look at this site. It gave me refreshing and new insight on how we can do much more on a website and do not have to follow a basic or traditional way.
