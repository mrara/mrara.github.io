## Why I'm Here

I'm currently majoring in Media Management and minoring in the Web Development. I chose Web Development as my minor because I realized that it is essential skills especially for the industry that I am interested in, the media industry. 

Nowadays, technology is everything. Everyone is using Internet, smartphone, etc. as part of everyday life. Understanding technical issues and building website became more essential skills rather than additional skills. 

### Current Inspiration 
- [Google](https://www.google.com) answers most of my questionst on life, academic, culture, social, the World, etc. 
- [CNN](https://www.cnn.com) gives me updates on the latest news from all over the World, especially in the U.S. 
- [ColumbiaEvents](http://events.colum.edu/) shows me list of upcoming, ongoing, past on campus events with specific date, time and location.
