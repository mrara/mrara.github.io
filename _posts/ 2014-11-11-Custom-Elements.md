## Custom Elements
Web Components are a collection of standards, which are working their way through the W3C. 
They enable truly encapsulated and reusable components for the web. 
And if you think HTML5 changed the web, wait to see what Web Components will do.

Custom elements describe the method for enabling the author to define and use new types of DOM elements in a document. 

HTML imports are a way to include and reuse HTML documents in other HTML documents. 

Templates describe a method for declaring inert DOM subtrees in HTML and manipulating them to instantiate document fragments with identical contents. 

Shadow DOM describes a method of establishing and maintaining functional boundaries between DOM trees and how these threes interact with each other within a document, thus enabling better functional encapsulation within the DOM.
