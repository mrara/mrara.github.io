## Native Apps vs. Web Apps

Native app is an app developed essentially for one particular mobile device and is installed directly onto the device itself. 
Native app usually can be downloaded via app stores online such as Apple Store, the Google Play, etc. 
Where web app is basically an Internet-enabled app that are accessible via the mobile device’s Web browser. 
It doesn't need to be downloaded on user’s mobile device in order to be accessed such as Safari browser. 

I personally prefer a web app instead of native app because it can access only a limited amount of a device’s native features and information. 
On the other hand, a native app usually can access our personal contact, camera or other features in the device. 

If someone asked which type of development they should learn, I will say to learn both of them. 
I think they have different features and elements that developers need to know before first deciding which one they want to develop.
