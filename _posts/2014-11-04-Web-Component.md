##  Web Components: A Tectonic Shift for Web Development

Web components are about custom elements in HTML, you can define new vocabulary for HTML. For instance, the blink tag is not dead. The blink tag is alive and well. We can call it x-blink, and all it is – it’s a custom element tat I’ve implemented using CSS, and it just has an opacity change using transitions. It’s not defining new elements but it’s actually extending existing. 

However, not all broswers/ platforms supports the component.  

So defining your own, extending it, being able to expand on what we have in HTML . Web components, so this ecosystem, this umbrella terminology for new stuff—I think of four main areas. I think of Shadow DOM, this is sort of the foundational glue, the mortar, this is how we get encapsulation for free on the web. HTML templates for building custom element, a widget, a component for a page, you need to be able to scaffold out sort of inert chunks of markup and then use those later as people stamp out your element. Custom elements brings all this together. This is how you define a new tag in HTML and put all these lower level technologies together. HTML import sort of is used for repackaging, repurposing if somebody writes this awesome component someplace over on the web, throws it up on a CDN, I can the import that into my page and reuse that. Web components is a collection of new API primitives in the browser.
