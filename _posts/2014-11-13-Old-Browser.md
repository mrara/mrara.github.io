## Browser Options

###The Internet Explorer 
Webopedia defined Internet Explorer as a Web browser that made its debut in 1995 as Microsoft's response to Netscape, 
one of the first graphical-based Web browsers and, at the time, the dominant browser in use with control of over 
90 percent of the market. Initially called Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE), 
Internet Explorer (IE) has long held the title of most popular browser in use, 
despite strong competition from the likes of Mozilla Firefox, Apple's Safari, Opera and Google Chrome.

###Why using Internet Explorer? 
Internet Explorer dominates the browser market share with over 90 percent of the market. 
People use Internet Explorer for different reasons such as: 
a.) it’s what they know and/or may even prefer; 
b.) they’re completely unaware of Internet Explorer’s security issues; 
c.) they don’t want to be bothered with downloading/installing/learning a new browser;  
d.) they rely on sites that only work in IE.

###Today 
Since the Internet Explorer dominates the browser market, they had no major competitors to enforce them for further innovation/ improvement. 
However, now people can have more options and alternatives to choose for their favorite browsers. 
With an easier, safer, and faster browser alternatives – Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc. people use Internet Explorer mainly for downloading/ installing these new browsers to their computers. 
Looking at this these past 10 years, Internet Explorer has been trying to cope with these new competitors by improving/ fixing their problems and still releasing new version of Internet Explorers. 
Still, we all cannot deny that the Internet Explorer dominates the browser market share.
